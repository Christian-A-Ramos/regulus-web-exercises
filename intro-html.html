        <h1>Let's sing a silly song:</h1>
        <p>A duck walked up to a lemonade stand</p>
        <p>And he said to the man, running the stand</p>
        <p>"Hey! (Bum bum bum) Got any grapes?"</p>
        <p>The man said</p>
        <p>"No we just sell lemonade. But it's cold</p>
        <p>And it's fresh</p>
        <p>And it's all home-made. Can I get you</p>
        <p>Glass?"</p>
        <p>The duck said,</p>
        <p>"I'll pass".</p>
